    <h1>Banana Bread</h1>
    <p>Banana bread is one of those things people rarely make on purpose, only when those last three bananas are almost black. This scrumptious banana-walnut loaf, spiked with dark chocolate chips, is so good you'll want to make it well before the bananas get to that condition</p>

        <li>Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add mashed bananas and beat until combined. Beat eggs into the butter mixture one at a time, fully blending each egg before adding the next. Stir vanilla extract and milk into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir chopped walnuts, chocolate chips, and flour mixture into banana mixture until just incorporated</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan. Tap pan on the counter to release any air pockets.</li>
